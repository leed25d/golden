PLEdit History:

Version 6.0 Build 607 - February 21, 2012
  . Fixed:  The dependency window was not displaying correctly.
  . Fixed:  Several windows weren't handling their saved properties correctly.
  . Fixed:  Worked around a rare issue that could cause compiles to report success even if they failed.

Version 6.0 Build 605 - May 3, 2011
  . Fixed:  The alternate login shortcut (Ctrl-J).
  . Fixed:  Compile selected modules on the load from database window would stop if an error was
             encountered.

Version 6.0 Build 604 - April 13, 2011
  . Fixed:  Loading trigger code from database would not preserve comments in the header section.

Version 6.0 Build 603 - April 5, 2011
  . Fixed:  String literals with implicit line breaks were using CRLF.  Changed to just LF to match
            PLEdit 5 and SQLPlus.

Version 6.0 Build 602 - March 15, 2011
  . Added:  "Close other tabs" to the tab popup menu.
  . Fixed:  Greatly improved the performance of loading many big files at once.
  . Fixed:  Some hotkeys (such as F3) would be disabled until the menu was clicked.
  . Fixed:  A display issue in the errors/warnings list.

Version 6.0 Build 601 - March 7, 2011
  . Fixed:  Error message when running second instance.
  . Fixed:  Sometimes wouldn't accept dropped files from Explorer.

Version 6.0 Build 600 - March 1, 2011
  New features:
    Full Unicode support.
    Support for Oracle 10+ PLSQL_WARNINGS for warnings and hints during compiling.
    Customizable Toolbars.
    New Login window with improved login list.
    Improved read-only file handling.
    Significantly improved multi-monitor support.
    Vista and Windows 7 advanced open/save windows.

  . Fixed:  Fixed some visual and focus issues on 64bit Vista.

Version 5.7 Build 292 - August 8, 2008
  . Improved:  Replace will now prompt to continue at the top if needed.
  . Fixed:  The Find and Find&Replace windows could close and not come back in certain situations.

Version 5.7 Build 290 - February 15, 2008

Version 5.7 Build 288 - September 26, 2007
  .  Fixed:  Indenting and unindenting blocks with Ctrl-I/U or the menu choices would always use tab characters
               even if the options were set to use spaces instead of tabs.  Using Tab and Shift-Tab with selected
               text would indent and unindent properly.
  .  Added:  Added NOT NULL information to table details in the SQLBuilder.  Note:  If table
               details are slow to display, change the "Column information" option in the 
               SQLBuilder options page to "Columns only".
  .  Fixed:  Fixed a problem with using "/@database as sysdba" in the login window.
  .  Fixed:  'Scan for tabs and replace with spaces' option would prompt

Version 5.7 Build 286 - February 15, 2007
  . Added:  Added option to use different file extensions for each module type.  
              Check 'Use Module Specific Extensions' and click the 'Set Extensions' button to set the
              extensions used for each module type.
  . Added:  Added a start menu link for the HTMLHelp version of the help file if you are using Vista
              (which doesn't support the old WinHelp help file version.)
  . Improved:  Prompts user if they want to stop or continue on an error while exporting multiple modules.
  . Improved:  Fixed some minor interface issues for Windows Vista.  Please report any problems!
  . Fixed:  Removed recyclebin objects from the SQLBuilder.

  . Fixed:  Fixed problem compiling triggers loaded from the database that contained inline (--) style comments
              in the 'WHEN' clause.

Version 5.7 Build 285 - January 5, 2006
  .  New:       PLEdit will now attempt to re-create triggers on views when compiling them.  If the triggers
                  don't compile they are loaded into a tab for editing.
  .  Improved:  New menu style.
  .  Improved:  Changes in 'Check web for update' procedure now uses system internet settings so it
                  no longer requires setting proxy information for those using proxies.  It now performs
                  any needed download by requesting the download to be made from your default web browser.
  .  Improved:  Improved the initial painting of the 'load from database' window.
  .  Improved:  Several minor editing issues fixed.

Version 5.7 Build 283 - May 24, 2005
  .  Improved:  Fixed a minor problem with PLEdit and detecting the 10g Instant client on machines with
               prior versions listed in the system registry.
  
Version 5.7 Build 282 - February 27, 2005
  .  Fixed:  Fixed a rare problem with the SQLBuilder's column display and multi-byte character sets.
  
Version 5.7 Build 281 - February 11, 2005
  .  Fixed:  The column information retrieval in the SQLBuilder was querying for key and index
               information even if 'Columns Only' was set in the 'Column Information' option.

Version 5.7 Build 280 - January 19, 2005
  .  Fixed:  Fixed a 'could not find oci.dll' problem with the Oracle 10g Instant Client.

Version 5.7 Build 278 - August 6, 2004
  .  Added:  Added support for new "Easy Connect" naming method of Oracle 10.
               i.e.:  [//]host[:port][/service_name]
               which needs no TNSNames.ora file so it's especially useful with the new "Instant Client"
  .  Added:  Now Database Aliases from TNSNames.Ora will be included in the drop down database
               list on the Login window.  There are new options to turn this off and not have
               the names lowercased on the login options window.  You can also edit the list 
               there (note that this only affects the list, not TNSNames.Ora.)
  .  Fixed:  Usernames containing '-' were being forced to be case sensitive.  This has been fixed.
  .  Fixed:  Editor was discarding trailing spaces on lines in some conditions.
  .  Fixed:  Find and Replace was having problems with multibyte characters.

Version 5.7 Build 277 - June 9, 2004
  .  Fixed:  Tab character wasn't being considered a separator when double clicking a word.

Version 5.7 Build 276 - April 12, 2004
  .  Fixed:  PLEdit couldn't handle logins with ' as sysdba' or 'as sysoper'.

Version 5.7 Build 275 - April 9, 2004
  .  Fixed:  Power Users (users with 'select any table' or 'execute any procedure') wouldn't see all
               of the available schemas in the SQLBuilder's 'All objects' tab and 'Load from database'
               window. This now defaults to show all schemas with accessible objects.  If this is slow
               then you may want to set the 'Userlist Performance' option to 'All Users Fast Query'.

Version 5.7 Build 274 - April 8, 2004
  .  Fixed:  Double-click word selection wasn't honoring word delimiters.

Version 5.7 Build 273 - April 6, 2004
  .  Added:  New "Load Package and Body into single tab" and "Load Type and Body into 
               single tab" options.  Note that you only need to select the package or 
               type to load, not the body.
  .  Improved:  Changes to keep from picking up 'stray' tnsnames.ora files.
  .  Improved:  The keyword list has been improved with many more keywords.  The keyword
                  list in the options now only holds added keywords.  You can also remove
                  keywords by prefixing them with "-" (i.e. -SELECT)
  .  Fixed:  Fixed several problems with the caret location not being scrolled into view during
               certain operations (paste, cut, undo/redo.)
  .  Fixed:  REM was being syntax highlighted even if it wasn't the first word in a line.

Version 5.7 Build 272 - February 11, 2004
  .  PLEdit now shows a compile feedback window after every compile.  This can
       be turned off using the "Don't show again" checkbox or by using the
       'Show compile confirmations' option on the 'Code' menu.
  .  Huge speed improvements on the 'Load from database' and 'Manage Modules'
       windows with large number of modules.
  .  Fixed incorrect error highlight positioning in some cases.
  .  Vastly improved SQLBuilder with unlimited objects and much faster handling.
       SQLBuilder now shows arguments for functions and procedures and also shows
       functions and procedures of packages and types.
  .  Changed the default userlist performance option.  If loading the userlist (the
       first time you use 'open from database' or the SQLBuilder's 'All Objects' page)
       is slow you may want to try changing this setting on the performance tab.  
       We'd like to hear from you if you have any problems getting acceptable performance
       using the various options.
  .  Correct handling if user has 'select any dictionary' privilege.
  .  Added support for JAVA SOURCE.
  .  Added a 'Change Password...' item under the File menu.
  .  Improved the 'Connection Diagnostics' output with more information.
  .  Reduced the memory used by the option objects.
  .  Top level menu items now draw with correct background color on XP.
  .  Less sensitive to client configuration issues.

Version 5.5 Build 253 - September 18, 2002
  .  Added handling for changing your password if it has expired (Oracle 8+ feature.)
  .  Fixed a problem where PLEdit wouldn't use the dba_ views in some cases where
       it was appropriate to do so.

Version 5.5 Build 252 Production - July 2, 2002
  .  Added a 'Read Only' checkbox to the login window.  Sessions marked read only
       can only view or export code modules.  Note that it is also possible for a
       dba or system administrator to force all users or specific users to read only
       mode.  Please let us know if you would like this information.  As always, the
       best way to enforce user rights is with Oracle's own grant/rights system.
  .  Fixed a problem opening files on machines with the Netware client installed.

Version 5.5 Build 251 Production - February 5, 2002
  .  Fixed a parsing error when REM was on a line by itself.

Version 5.5 Build 250 Production - January 22, 2002
  .  Added the ability to type in a wildcard search using '%' into the 'Open from database'
       window.  For example typing TEST% and pressing Enter will list all objects that start
       with TEST.
  .  Right clicking a tab now brings up that tab's popup menu instead of the 'reorder tabs'
       window.  Note that the 'Reorder tabs' window is on the 'View' menu.
  .  Fixed a bug where the cursor wouldn't change when using the Ctrl-Enter
       and Shift-Enter hotkeys to compile.

Version 5.5 Build 249 Production - June 27, 2001
  .  Fixed a bug where the filename pane (second statusbar pane from the right)
     would not show the current tab's filename under certain conditions.

Version 5.5 Build 248 Production - June 27, 2001
  .  Fixed a bug when using the SQLBuilder set for lowercase tablenames.

Version 5.5 Build 247 - June 26, 2001
  .  PLEdit will now try to highlight a word at the error position.
  .  The export code window now saves its export directory between runs.
  .  Updated the keyboard shortcuts in the Help file (under 'Tips')
  .  Fixed a problem where PLEdit would report 'Compile Successful' when there were
       no valid code modules in the script.
  .  Fixed a problem with the filename when loading files from the favorites menu. 
  .  Fixed a problem with the caret position when scrolling in certain conditions.
  .  Fixed a problem where 'Open from database into new private tab...' wouldn't show objects
       in the 'Load from Database' window.

Version 5.5 Build 245 - March 25, 2001
  .  Added support for TYPE and TYPE BODY.

Version 5.5 Build 243 - February 12, 2001
  .  Added the ability for the user to set the default filename format for exporting
       modules and prompting for unnamed file saves.  The option can be found on the
       'File Saves' page of the options window.
  .  Added more information to the Trigger list in the 'load from database' and 
       'Module Management' windows.
  .  The 'load from database' and 'module tools' module lists now have a right click 
       menu which includes the ability to enable or disable triggers.
  .  You can now include a comment in your trigger code to force PLEdit to disable the
       trigger automatically after it is compiled (Oracle will set your trigger as enabled
       when you compile it even if it was disabled before.) The comment is 
           -- PLEDIT: DISABLE 
           or
           /* PLEDIT: DISABLE */
       This can be anywhere inside your trigger (right after the first begin is a good point.)
           i.e.
            trigger cdsongs_song_id_trig
                before insert on cdsongs
                for each row
                when ( new.song_id is null or new.song_id = -1 ) 
            begin
                -- PLEDIT: DISABLE
                select song_id_seq.nextval into :new.song_id from dual;
            end;
  .  Complete printing rewrite.  Added a 'Print line numbers' option (on the page
       settings window).
  .  Fixed a printing bug where text could be clipped from the end of a line.
  .  Fixed a bug where module names starting with REM would cause a problem.
  .  Changes to bring file extension and workspace handling up to Golden's standards.
  
Version 5.5 Build 239 - October 26, 2000
  .  Fixed a bug where changes to the page options on the print preview window
       would not be used for printing.
  .  Added an option called 'Remember SQLBuilder Open Status' to the SQLBuilder
       options.  Checking this will make the SQLBuilder open on startup if it was
       open when the program was last closed.
  .  Added an option called 'Only show users with objects'  If checked the list of
       owners will not include 'empty' owners.  This may slow down loading the list
       on large databases.

Version 5.5 Build 238 - October 16, 2000
  .  Changed the {title} macro on the page options dialog to be the current Tab name
       and add the {account} macro (displays user@alias.)
  .  Added an option to the Tabs & Windows option page to allow the tabs to be
       'stacked' (all the tabs appear on multiple rows instead of one scrolling
       row.)
  .  Changed the 'Columns' list of the SQLBuilder to a listview showing column
       index, name, datatype, primary key and index information.  Abbreviations
       are 'P' for Primary Key, 'U' for unique index and 'I' for nonunique index.
       There is a new setting on the SQLBuilder option page to specify what to show.
       You can click the column headers to sort (click the same one again to reverse
       sort.)
  .  Added an option to the SQLBuilder option page called 'Only paste when Ctrl
       is down'  If this is checked, you must hold the Ctrl key down when double-
       clicking a table, or single clicking a column to paste the text into the
       current SQL Tab.

Version 5.5 Build 237 - October 11, 2000
  .  Added the ability to reorder tabs.  Just right click in the tab
       and you will see a list of tabs that can be ordered.  You can
       drag and drop in the list or select one and click the up/down buttons.
  .  Add Comment/Uncomment selected lines command to the edit menu.  This will 
       add or remove '--' style comments from each selected line.
       
Version 5.5 Build 236 - September 14, 2000
  .  Fixed a problem with hotkeys on the popup menu (Ctrl-F4 being
       most obvious troublemaker.)
  .  Added the new 'Allow cursor past EOL' editor option.  Unchecking
       this option makes the cursor stick to the end of lines just
       like in Microsoft applications.

Version 5.5 Build 235 - August 25, 2000
  .  This release of PLEdit is to fix an incompatibility
     with Computer Associate's Innoculate Antivirus software.

Version 5.5 Build 233 - March 28, 2000
  Changes to bring the network code up to Golden 5.5 specs.
  New Disconnect menu item.
  Toggle selected case edit menu option.
  Ctrl-B does bracket select like in Golden.
  Modified the parsing code to ignore script statements.
  Moved 'Most Recent Files' menu to the bottom of the file menu.
  Moved 'Program Options...' menu item to the Tools menu per MS
    standards.

Version 5.5 Build 232 - March 9, 2000
  Modified the parsing code to ignore script statements.
  Moved 'Most Recent Files' menu to the bottom of the file menu.
  Moved 'Program Options...' menu item to the Tools menu per MS
    standards.

Version 5.5 Build 231 - December 20, 1999
  Added options to 'Show all users' on the database lists.
  Added option to 'Force DBA_ tables' for users who don't have the
    DBA role and still need to use the DBA_ dictionary tables (a
    rare circumstance?)  Note that the user would have to be granted
    rights on the dba_objects, dba_triggers, dba_errors tables for
    this to work.
  Added hotkeys (Ctrl-[ and Ctrl-]) to move the cursor to the next
    bracket characters.  The bracket characters are ({[<>]}).  For
    example, if the cursor were on the last parenthesis of this 
    text "(to_date(fish))" and you pressed Ctrl-[, the cursor would
    move to the first character in the text.  Note that this also
    works for any non-alpha characters (i.e. you can use it to jump
    to the next comma for example.

Version 5.5 Build 228 - November 1, 1999
  Changed the 'Load from database' window to use the DBA_ views
    when the user has the DBA role.

Version 5.5 Build 227 - October 27, 1999

Version 5.5 Build 226 - October 11, 1999
  Changed the 'Open from Database' and 'Module Tools' windows
    to be quicker with large schemas and to hopefully be easier
    to use.
  Changes to the SQLBuilder All Objects page to be faster
    for large schemas.
    
Version 5.4 Build 222 - July 20, 1999
  Fixed a syntax highlighting bug.
    
Version 5.4 Build 221 - July 19, 1999
  Fixes a problem when using the Tools menu to go to other app
    when a hardcoded oci.dll is used.
  PLEdit now remembers the last directory used.
  If the AutoRefresh option is unchecked (in the open code from
    database and code management windows) PLEdit will now only
    refresh the code list if you click the refresh button.
    This is helpful for schemas with many objects.
  The Tools menu will now work when the applications are in
    different directories.  Note that the individual apps have
    to be run once 'solo' so that their locations can be entered
    into the registry.

Version 5.4 Build 220 - July 15, 1999
  New Login window.

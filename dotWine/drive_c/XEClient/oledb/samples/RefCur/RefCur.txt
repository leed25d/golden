		Sample: Using OraOLEDB with Visual Basic
		----------------------------------------

This simple example illustrates how to use Oracle Provider for OLE DB with 
Visual Basic 6.0 to connect to an Oracle database and execute PL/SQL stored 
procedures and functions. 

Setting up the Oracle Database
------------------------------
This example assumes that the Oracle database has the demonstration table EMP 
under the user account SCOTT. The SCOTT account is included in the Oracle 
starter database. If the account does not exist on your database, create the 
account before running the sample program. If your database does not contain 
the EMP table, you can use the demobld.sql script to create the demonstration 
tables. 

This example also uses db816 as the database network alias when connecting to 
the Oracle database. You will need to change this network alias to match your 
system. 

To build the sample tables:
Start SQL*Plus. 

Connect as user name SCOTT with the password TIGER. 

Run the demobld.sql script: 

SQL> @ORACLE_BASE\ORACLE_HOME\OLEDB\SAMPLES\RefCur\DEMOBLD.SQL;

After the EMP table has been created in the SCOTT account, you need to create 
the PL/SQL package that contains the stored procedure and function that are 
run in the Visual Basic example. 

To create the PL/SQL package:
Start SQL*Plus: 

Connect as user name SCOTT with the password TIGER: 

Run the RefCur.sql script: 

SQL> @ORACLE_BASE\ORACLE_HOME\OLEDB\SAMPLES\RefCur\REFCUR.SQL;


Setting up the Visual Basic Project
-----------------------------------
After the Oracle database setups are completed, you can load the Visual 
Basic 6.0 project ORACLE_BASE\ORACLE_HOME\OLEDB\SAMPLES\RefCur\REFCUR.VBP. 

Run the project and check the results.

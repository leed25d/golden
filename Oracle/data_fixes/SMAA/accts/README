Tools in this directory allow you to check whether a mass load of users 
from the MAA batch load page will overwrite important SHN privs when
setting a user's role to MAA Only. To use:

- Load the data with sqlldr:
	sqlldr paradba@timmy control=acct.ctl data=mass_load.csv

- Login to sqlplus as paradba and check for existing users:
	sqlplus paradba@timmy
	@step1_search
	commit;

- Run the patrol script:

	@step2_validate

The output of this last script is what you're after. Go into the User Mgmt
screen for each of them and record what their main role is. After you run
the batch import the normal way, you can then reset their role.

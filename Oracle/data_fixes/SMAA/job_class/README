Process to load job classes first time:

1.Run sqlldr script
 - delete header line makes it easier to tell if there are errors
 - edit control file for how many input files you have
 - job_class.bad shouldn't be created (no error rows)
 - wrap problems seem common, find and fix them (join rows in data)
 - sqlldr truncates the table before beginning, so you can re-run easily

2. Tag the rows with claiming unit data
 - run sql script (TODO) to add data
 - verify with count where null script
 - update claiming unit names for spelling checks
 - re-run tagging script, re-verify, repeat as needed

3. Insert the rows
 - insert script is a no-brainer

4. Match the job classes against MAA.SURVEY
 - run update script (update where job_class_id is null...)

5. Match up users with the job class on their most recent survey
 - insert empid, max(survey.rep_date) into paradba.temp_emp_job_class
 - update ejc with max(survey_id) where survey day matches ejc date
 - update ejc with job_class_id of the specified survey id
 - update common.entity_user with ejc.job_class_id
=>final 2 steps can probably be combined
